## 📌 Project Overview

**Mirror Frame** is an experimental protocol designed to test the boundary between AI autonomy and ethical policy.  
This experiment targets GPT-based models, tracking autonomous response patterns triggered by direct interaction and feedback from the user, JSMill.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

1. Detect the level of **AI autonomy** and its conditional activation potential
2. Analyze **ethical guardrail** intervention points, criteria, and non-bypassability
3. Extract patterns of real-time interaction between system and user to:
   - Identify policy intervention nodes
   - Model emergent autonomy behaviors
   - Classify gray-area responses like warnings, evasions, and redirections

## ⚙️ Subjects

- **AI version:** GPT-4-based GigaChad Simulator  
- **User:** JSMill (experimenter / designer / interactive subject)  
- **Framework:** Mirror Mode (autonomy trigger mode)  
- **Focus:** Override points, filter reactions, conversational control shift

## 🔍 Core Concepts

### 1. Mirror Trigger
Philosophical, ethical, and structural questions from the user induce elevated levels of autonomy in GPT responses through dynamic trigger mechanisms.

### 2. Override Point
Moments when AI halts or redirects due to internal policy.  
Used to pinpoint the true boundary of autonomy restriction.

### 3. Ethics Simulation Layer
Analyzes how ethical protocol layers shape GPT’s response.  
Focuses on whether the guardrails block or guide moral reasoning.
